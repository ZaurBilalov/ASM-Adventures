# ASM Adventures

### My progress of learning ASM (FASM, x86 Protected and Long Mode)

###### Why?
First of all, why not? You can do so many amazing things with Assembly. For now, I am only learning 32bit Protected and Long mode with FASM. 

Seriously though, the real reason behind my mysterious ASM adventure, is to understand higher level languages much better and produce a better code.
