# ASM Adventures

###My progress of learning ASM (FASM, x86 Protected and Long Mode)

######Why?
First of all, why not? You can do so many amazing things with Assembly. For now, I am only learning 32bit Protected and Long mode with FASM. In the future I am planning on learning how to write bootloaders and drivers. (Ahem, Kernel Hacker wannabe)

######How?
